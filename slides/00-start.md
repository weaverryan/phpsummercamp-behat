#### Welcome to Behat!

To get started, make sure everything is loading ok! If you're having
any problems at all, just ask!

A) Start up the virtual machine!

B) ssh into the machine and find where the project lives

C) Run `git fetch origin`

D) You should be able to go to
`http://behat.ezsc/` and see a silly-looking
(but functional) site.

E) Make sure you have a nice editor on your system and you're
able to see and edit the files on the virtual machine.

F) Say "Hi" to your neighbor :)
